▪ Create a javascript function that takes firstname and lastname as 2 parameters and
uses console.log() to output the person's name. Check that it works and is printet
correctly.
▪ Create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. The function should return
the result. Test that it works.
▪ Create a function that takes speed and time as 2 parameters and calculates and
returns the distance. Use the function to test that it works by using the 'log' again.
Print out "You have travelled _x_ km" where _x_ is replaced by the result from the
function.
▪ Create an object called calculator with the name of the owner (eg. Your name) and
modify your code so the 3 previous functions are attached to the object.
▪ Adjust your code so that you can call the functions and test that they still work.

▪ Create a Cat class with name, color, breed.
▪ Create a constructor that takes 3 parameters to create an object with name, color,
breed.
▪ Create a function/method that returns the cat's data.
▪ Create a function that can change the cat's name.

▪ Define the Car class:
▪ Create a class named Car.
▪ Add a constructor that accepts make, model, and year as parameters and initializes these
properties.
▪ Add Methods:
▪ getCarInfo method: This method should return a string containing the car's make, model, and
year.
▪ start method: This method should set a property called isRunning to true and return a
string indicating the car has started.
▪ stop method: This method should set the isRunning property to false and return a string
indicating the car has stopped.
▪ Create Instances and Test Methods:
▪ Create two instances of the Car class with different make, model, and year values.
▪ Call the getCarInfo, start, and stop methods on these instances and print the results to verify
that everything works as expected.

Create an array with 5 names. Print out the first element (name) using console.log()
▪ Use the indexOf function to get the index of a name that exists in your array.
▪ Try the indexOf function with a name that does not exist. What is returned?
▪ Use the push function to add a new name to the array of names, so you have 6
names in the array. 'log' the array to verify.
▪ Use the slice function on the array, to create a new array with the first 3 names. 'log'
the array to verify.
▪ Create 2 objects with firstname, lastname, email – values. Add the two objects to a
new array. 'log' the array to verify. Also 'log' the first objects' email in a separate
'log'.

▪ Exercise: Student Grades Management
▪ Create a Student Object:
▪ Define a Student object with properties: name, id, and grades (an array of numbers).
▪ Add Grades:
▪ Write a function named addGrade that takes a Student object and a grade (number) as
parameters, and adds the grade to the student's grades array.
▪ Update Student Name:
▪ Write a function named updateStudentName that takes a Student object and a new name as
parameters and updates the student's name.
▪ Test the Functions:
▪ Create a student object.
▪ Add a few grades to the student.
▪ Update the student's name and print the updated object.
